To run on your Windows desktop computer, download the following files: 
- owa-test.bat
- OWAFrame.class
- OWAFrame$1.class
- OWAFrame$2.class
...and double-click the .bat file in Windows Explorer or run from the Windows command line. 

If you can figure out how to run the applet from the HTML file, please let me know. I was not able to do this as of 2017, possibly due to Web browser security settings?
